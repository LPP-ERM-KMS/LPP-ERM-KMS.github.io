==================================
Installation
---------------------------------
To install the program you'll just have to move to the folder "dist" where the
install file is located and run 

.. code-block:: console

        (.venv) $pip install pyrftk2-2.0.0-py3-none-any.whl

Max voltage i.f.o distance
--------------------------
We'll start by looking at a simple circuit, below the code is given and below that
the code is explained line by line.

.. code-block:: python

        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

        from pyRFtk import rfCircuit, rfTRL, rfRLC
        from pyRFtk import plotVSWs


        TRL1 = rfTRL(L=1.1, OD=0.230, ID=[0.100, 0.130], dx=360) # a conical TL
        TRL2 = rfTRL(L=1.1, Z0TL=40, dx=360)
        TRL3 = rfTRL(L=2, ports=['E', 'T'], Zbase=40, dx=360) # <- just for fun
        RLC2 = rfRLC(Cp=100e-12)

        ct = rfCircuit()
        ct.addblock('TL1', TRL1, ports=['T', 'E'], relpos=TRL3.L)
        ct.addblock('TL2', TRL2, ports=['T', 'E'], relpos=TRL3.L)
        ct.addblock('TL3', TRL3)
        ct.addblock('Cap', RLC2, ports=['E','oc'], relpos=TRL3.L + TRL2.L)
        ct.connect('TL1.T', 'TL2.T', 'TL3.T')
        ct.connect('TL1.E', 'Cap.E')
        ct.terminate('Cap.oc', Y=0)   # open circuit !
        ct.terminate('TL2.E', Z=10)  # finite impedance

        maxV, where, VSWs = ct.maxV(f=55e6, E={'TL3.E': 1})
        plotVSWs(VSWs) 

        plt.show()

**rfTRL** makes a radio frequency Transmission Line object, L is the length of
the TL section, OD is the outer diameter, ID is the inner diameter, Z0TL is the
characteristic impedance, Zbase is the reference impedance of the S-matrix representing the TL section and dx is the dimensional step along the TL used to solve the telegraphist's ODE.

As can be seen in the definition of TRL1, we create a conical TL by specifying an inner diameter
at the leftmost side of 0.1 and an inner diameter at the rightmost side of 0.13.


**rfRLC** can build the following circuit structure:

.. image:: Images/RLC.png

the *kwargs* are:

* Zbase : reference impedance [50 Ohm]
* ports : port names [['s','p']]
* Rp : parallel resistance [+inf Ohm]
* Lp : parallel inductance [+inf H]
* Cp : parallel capacity [0 F]
* Rs : series resistance [0 Ohm]
* Ls : series inductance [0 H]
* Cs : series capacity [+inf F]  

Here we only implement a parallel capacitor, i.e:


.. image:: Images/RLCSC.png

Now that we have our building blocks, it's time to put them together in a circuit. To do this
we create a rfCircuit() instance which we'll call ct and add the blocks.

The first block which we'll add is TRL1 which we'll call 'TL1', we'll label the leftmost
port 'T' and the rightmost port 'E'. As a reference point we'll use the length of TRL3,
then we'll connect both TRL2 and TRL3 to the same input port 'T' and output port 'E' (note that
we have specified the ports of TRL3 already in the block itself).

Now we'll add our T-section containing the parallel capacitor, we labeled the source (s) as "E" and the output (p) as "oc". Afterwards
we place this circuit part 1.1m away from the place where we put our transmission lines.

These ports now need to be connected, we first connect all the ports labeled "T" and then
all the ports labeled "E". We then proceed to leave the circuit open at the righthand side (Y=0 means zero admittance at oc) and place a 10 Ohm impedance at E, terminating the circuit there.

In the end, our circuit thus looks like:

.. figure:: Images/SC.png

Now we apply a signal to the point 'TL3.E' with a frequency of 55MHz, using maxV  we can
then get back maxV, which is the maximal voltage over the full circuit, where, which says where this happened and VSWs (Voltage Standing Waves) which is an array-like value containing data on how the voltage changes over the distance, this can then be plotted using plotVSWs.

S-matrix
--------
The program is capable of combining circuits and calculating the S matrix for
certain frequencies, an example is given below:

.. code-block:: python

        from pyRFtk import rfCircuit, rfTRL
        from pyRFtk.printMatrices import printMA 

        A = rfCircuit()
        A.addblock('TL1', rfTRL(L=0))
        A.addblock('TL2', rfTRL(L=0))
        A.connect('TL1.1','TL2.1','TA')

        B = rfCircuit()
        B.addblock('TL1', rfTRL(L=0))
        B.addblock('TL2', rfTRL(L=0))
        B.connect('TL1.1','TL2.1','TB')

        C = rfCircuit()
        C.addblock('A', A)
        C.addblock('B', B)
        C.addblock('TL3',rfTRL(L=0))
        C.connect('A.TA','B.TB','TL3.1')

        printMA(C.getS(1E6))

Here we create a circuit C consisting of a transmission line of length 0, which has as an input
(if no port names are given, 1 is the left input and 2 is the right output) of A and B, each of
which are two 0 lenght coax cables of which the inputs are wired together.

We calculate the S matrix at 1MHz and print it using printMA, this funciton makes it posible
to print complex matrices in easy to read format, e.g it will give an output *0.6 +180Â°* impying

.. math::

   \rho e^{i\theta} = 0.6 e^{i\pi} = -0.6

Multiple ports and Logging
--------------------------

.. code-block:: python
        
        from pyRFtk import rfCircuit, rfTRL, plotVSWs
        from pyRFtk.printMatrices import printMA 
        from pyRFtk.config import setLogLevel
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

        TRL1 = rfTRL(L=1.1, ports=['1a','1b'])
        TRL2 = rfTRL(L=2.1, ports=['2a','2b'])

        CT1 = rfCircuit()
        CT1.addblock('TRL1', TRL1, relpos= 0. )
        CT1.addblock('TRL2', TRL2, relpos= 1.1 )
        CT1.connect('TRL1.1b','TRL2.2a')

        TRL3 = rfTRL(L=1.3, ports=['3a','3b'])
        TRL4 = rfTRL(L=1.4, ports=['4a','4b'])
        CT2 = rfCircuit()
        CT2.addblock('TRL3', TRL3, relpos= 0. )
        CT2.addblock('TRL4', TRL4, relpos= 1.3)
        CT2.connect('TRL3.3b','TRL4.4a')
        CT2.terminate('TRL4.4b', RC=0.5j)

        CT3 = rfCircuit()
        CT3.addblock('CT1', CT1, relpos= 0. )
        CT3.addblock('CT2', CT2, relpos= 0. )
        CT3.connect('CT1.TRL1.1a','CT2.TRL3.3a','ct1')

        CT4 = rfCircuit(Id='Duh')
        CT4.addblock('TRL5', rfTRL(L=2.5, ports=['5a','5b']), relpos= 0. )
        CT4.addblock('CT3', CT3, relpos= 2.5 )
        CT4.connect('TRL5.5b','CT3.ct1')

        setLogLevel('DEBUG')
        maxV, where, VSWs = CT4.maxV(f=45e6, E={'TRL5.5a':1, 'CT3.CT1.TRL2.2b':0.5})
        setLogLevel('CRITICAL')
        plotVSWs(VSWs)

        plt.show()

Here we excite two ports: TRL5.5a with a 1V wave and CT3.CT1.TRL2.2b with a 0.5V wave. As can be seen in the code
